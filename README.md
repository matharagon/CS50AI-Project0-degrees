# CS50AI Project 0: Degrees - A Python Implementation of a Degrees of Separation Algorithm
# This is a Python implementation of a degrees of separation algorithm as part of CS50AI Project 0. The algorithm uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path between two actors in a given database of movies and actors.

## Installation
To install the project, you need Python 3 and the packages listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
To use the program, run the following command in the terminal:

```python degrees.py degrees.py```

The program will output the shortest path between the two actors, or "No path found" if no path exists.
